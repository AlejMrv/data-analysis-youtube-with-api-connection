In May 2016, when I graduated from college, I had never written a line of code in my life. Roughly 6 months later, I got a job at Google as a Software Engineer. In this video, I dive into how exactly I learned to code in 6 months and then got into Google (what coding bootcamp I attended, what projects I did, etc.).\\n\\nHere's the video on how I landed my interviews at Google: https://youtu.be/GyYsnK434DM\\n\\nPrepping for coding interviews?

After pitching it to my close friend, we built an MVP (minimum viable product) and gave the product out for free until we landed our first sale. Now, two and a half years later, we've grown this side hustle into an established company that serves tens of thousands of customers and that generates 50,000 dollars per month.\\n\\nWith this video, I hope to share my experience of what it's like to build and grow a profitable side business.\\n\\nPrepping for coding interviews?
