# Project Name
Data Analysis for Youtube Channels

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
This is a data science project to explore the data and understand what patterns, behavior and/or relationship exists between the video/comment statistics of youtube channels that share personal development content. For the present analysis I chose channels that are active to date and have more than 10000 views on their latest videos.

This was developed thanks to the content of the channel "Thu Vu Data Analytics"

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* NLP

### Technologies
* Python
* Youtube API
* Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, jupyter
* NLTK, World Cloud

## Needs of this project

- requests API
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data can be extract from Youtube API. To more information see this [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/).    
3. Data exploration, processing/transformation and modeling scripts are being kept in youtube-analysis-channels.ipynb
4. The code for API requests video and comments stats is located in the notebook.  . Therefore it could be cloned to analyze new youtube channels.
5. This project was developed thanks to the content shared on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56_Cx36oGY&t=795s) "Thu Vu Data Analytics"
